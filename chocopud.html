    <h1>Chocolate Puddino</h1>
    <img src="img/chocopud.jpg" alt=""> <br>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Perfect for Valentine's Day, this rich and delicious chocolate pudding is made with a classic Italian method that they call "budino." The pudding has a glorious texture--firm enough to stay on the spoon and hold its shape, but at the same time, soft, smooth, and silky. It's a perfect balance between intense chocolate flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with a soft whipped cream topping that elevates it to a whole new level of amazingness!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Puddings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream, or to taste</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shaved dark chocolate, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chocolate chips, salt, and cayenne in a heat-proof measuring cup; set aside.</li>
            <li>Separate eggs by cracking one egg into your hand over a bowl. Open your fingers slightly and gently jiggle your hand until the egg white falls into the bowl below. Transfer the yolk to a skillet. Repeat with remaining eggs. Reserve egg whites for another use.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, milk, and cream to egg yolks. Whisk thoroughly, breaking egg yolks first, until well combined.</li>
            <li>Place skillet on the stove over medium or medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spoon, until very hot and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should read at least 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Set a fine sieve over the bowl of reserved chocolate. Strain the custard sauce into the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until chocolate has melted and custard sauce is smooth and shiny, about 2 minutes. Add vanilla and butter; stir until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour warm custard sauce into 6 serving glasses. Tilt each glass and rotate it around so the warm chocolate coats another 1/2 inch of the glass. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator until completely chilled, at least 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine cream and vanilla extract for topping in a metal bowl and whisk until thickened; make sure no peaks form. Spoon cream into the glasses, then tilt and twirl to coat the sides a bit.</li>
            <li>Garnish with shaved chocolate and serve.</li>
        </ol>
